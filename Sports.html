<p>"Being from New York City and an avid sports fan, the New York Mets are the team I follow the most and keep a close eye on throughout the duration of the season. This is an image of their field they play it in Flushing Queens. I am also a fan of the Jets, Knicks, and Rangers, however there is something about the Mets that puts my fandom above the others."</p>
